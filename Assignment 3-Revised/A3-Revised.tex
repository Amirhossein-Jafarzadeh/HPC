In this assignment, I have considered interactions and partitioning in order to parallelization for Zombie Land problem.\\
To do so, I have made some changes in the movement function. In new movement function, first, for each individual, we should check whether there are some empty nearby lattice sites to occupy or not. If there are some empty lattice sites, individual will move randomly to one of the nearby lattice sites. On the other hand, if there are not any empty lattice sites, it will not move.\\
Furthermore, I have added two new functions in my code.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interaction function:}\\
Interaction function checks the nearby lattice sites for each susceptible individual and if there are one or more zombies in the proximity of susceptible individual, so the state of this individual changes to zombie. For the individuals in the corner of rectangular field, there are two nearby lattice sites and for other individuals on the boundaries there are three directions to check. Also this function checks four directions(left, right, up, and down) for other individuals inside the boundaries.\\
In addition, this function updates the number of zombies and individual after every changes in the state of individuals.

\item \textbf{Partition function:}\\
First, partition function divides the fields to 1, 2, 3, or 4 partitions based on number of threads we need for parallelization in such a way that each partition has at most one more row than any other partition.\\
Next, this function specifies the partition in which each individual is. I have added a new characteristic for each individual which is a partition number. This variable can be changed after each movement for each individuals.\\
In addition, I have added another characteristic for each individual which is a position in a partition. Each individual could be on the first or last row(top or bottom boundary) of a partition or interior of a partition. Partition function has another duty to give appropriate value to this position variable based on the position of individual in a specific partition.

\textbf{Outputs:} The number of zombies and susceptible individuals at the first and last step.\\
List of individuals' characteristics at the first step and at the last step, after $T$ times movements.\\\\
\textbf{Testing:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Different number of individuals:}\\
First,I fixed the rectangular field size at $10^4$ by $10^4$ which is large enough. Then I increased the number of individuals from $200$ to $4000$ and then find wall time for each scenario.
You can see the results in the plot below:\\

\item \textbf{Different number of movements:}\\
In this test the same as previous test I fixed the rectangular field size at $10^4$ by $10^4$. Also I fixed the number of individuals at $100$ and then increase the number of movements from 200 to 4000. You can see the relationship between wall time and number of movements in the plot below:
